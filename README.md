    - [Distributed MIMO](./distributed_wireless_systems/distributed_mimo.md)
    - [Distributed LoRa](./distributed_wireless_systems/lora_receiver.md)
    - [Satellite Communications](./distributed_wireless_systems/satellite_comm.md)
- [Backscatter Communications](./backscatter_communications)
    - [Wi-Fi Backscatter](./backscatter_communications/wifi_backscatter.md)

## How to Share Papers

If someone wants to share his paper list to others with this project, it is recommended to use [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) in GitHub.
Please read the doc of pull request first.

To add the papers, Please create a new directory with at least a file named as *README.md*.
*README.md* in the new directory can include a brief introduction about the papers.
Other markdown files can list the papers with different communities.

A good example please refers to the markdown in [*Distributed Wireless Systems*](./distributed_wireless_systems) directory.
