# MoreWireless

MoreWireless is a project to share awesome and new papers about wireless communications and computer networks.

The papers are mostly chosen from top conferences in the corresponding communities, including but not limited to SIGCOMM, MobiCom, NSDI, MobiSys, SenSys, INFOCOM, etc.

This list is not guaranteed to contain all papers.

## How to Share Papers

If someone wants to share his paper list to others with this project, it is recommended to use [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) in GitHub.
Please read the doc of pull request first.

To add the papers, Please create a new directory with at least a file named as *README.md*.
*README.md* in the new directory can include a brief introduction about the papers.
Other markdown files can list the papers with different communities.

A good example please refers to the markdown in [*Distributed Wireless Systems*](./distributed_wireless_systems) directory.
