# MoreWireless

MoreWireless is a project to share awesome and new papers about wireless communications and computer networks.

The papers are mostly chosen from top conferences in the corresponding communities, including but not limited to SIGCOMM, MobiCom, NSDI, MobiSys, SenSys, INFOCOM, etc.

## Paper list

- [Distributed Wireless Systems](./distributed_wireless_systems)
    - [Distributed MIMO](./distributed_wireless_systems/distributed_mimo.md)
    - [Distributed LoRa](./distributed_wireless_systems/lora_receiver.md)
    - [Satellite Communications](./distributed_wireless_systems/satellite_comm.md)
- [Backscatter Communications](./backscatter_communications)
    - [Wi-Fi Backscatter](./backscatter_communications/wifi_backscatter.md)
    - [LoRa Backscatter](./backscatter_communications/lora_backscatter.md)
    - [RFID and others](./backscatter_communications/RFID.md)

## How to Share Paper Lists

If someone wants to share his paper list to this project, it is recommended to use [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) in GitHub.
Please read the doc of pull request first.


To add the paper list, you need to create a new directory with at least a file named as *README.md*.
*README.md* in the sub-directory can include a brief introduction about this topic.
You also can create other markdown files for different sub-topics of your paper list.

A good example please refers to the markdown in [*Distributed Wireless Systems*](./distributed_wireless_systems) directory.
